A Novel Multi-Modal, Multi-Scale Dual-Stage Glioma Segmentation Network Using MRI Images
	A lightweight, multi-scale feature residual module as the backbone of U-Net, enabling the extraction of diverse and effective features.
	Integration of Receptive Field Blocks into the encoder and decoder parts as enhancement modules to capture multi-scale features and obtain richer contextual information.
	Modification of skip connections to a multi-scale skip connection structure, and employment of an attention mechanism-based decoder to overcome the limitations of receiving same-scale feature information.
